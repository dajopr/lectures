        "# Exercise: Camera Calibration and Undistortion\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:** To understand and apply the camera calibration process using OpenCV to find camera intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients. This exercise will cover preparing calibration patterns, finding corners, performing calibration, and applying the results to undistort an image.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background:**\n",
        "Camera calibration is a crucial step in many computer vision applications. It involves determining the camera's intrinsic parameters (like focal length and optical centers) and distortion coefficients. OpenCV provides tools to perform calibration using images of a known pattern, such as a chessboard. Once calibrated, images can be undistorted to remove lens artifacts."
